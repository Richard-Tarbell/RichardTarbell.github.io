            <h2>Undergrad</h2>
            <p>Orginally an accounting major freshman year I took one accounting course and knew it wasn't the career path for me. Not sure where to go next that following summer
				I decided to pursue my interest in Astronomy and made the drastic switch to Physics. While it was a challenging 4 more years (I took a victory lap) I wouldn't have it
				any other way! </p>
			<p>While in my undergraduate I became heavily involved with the physics department and the organizations within it. Eventually becoming the 
				President of the Society of Physics Students (SPS) from Spring 2019 all the way up until graduation in Spring 2021. While I was President our chapter recieved 
				the <b><a href="https://www.spsnational.org/awards/outstanding-chapter/recipients/2020">Outstanding Chapter Award</a></b> which is the highest distinction given to 
				chapters and is received by less than 15% of the top chapters annually. </p>
			<p>Early on in my physics degree I had the privelege of meeting the observatory manager at UTSA, Bryan Tobias. Bryan and I quickly became close and he entrusted me with setting
				up the telescopes and assisting during outreach events that the department hosted. This only helped fuel my love for astronomy and I found myself using the telescopes 
				by myself every chance I got (weather permitting). It was during my time volunteering with the observatory I Co-Founded the Astronomy Club along another volunteer Greg. </p>

			<h2>Graduate School</h2>
			<h3>Why Grad School?</h3>
			<p>As I became involved with research during undergrad I had to face the harsh reality that a life of astronomy research wasn't for me. While I do have love for the field 5+ more years
				of school for a PhD was out of the picture (mostly to prevent burnout). However I still have a heavy interest in computational problem solving and working with all kinds of data. I began 
				looking for traditional career paths for physics and the choices were slim. It seemed I either was going to end up in a lab or I need to batten down the hatches and really expand my computational
				skillset. Naturally I looked at towards the field of Data Science, with the complex problem solving and the collaboration I knew it was the perfect fit for me. With this knowledge and desire to 
				pursue my new plan I started looking at the Master of Science in Data Analytics program at UTSA. With the program offering a daytime cohort option allowing to finish in one calendar year along with 
				professors and courses ranging from cyber security to data ethics it was an easy decision.
			</p>
			<h3>Courses</h3>
			<p>While I've only been in the program for one semester (Fall 2021) I've gained a ton of knowledge and insight to the world of Data Analytics. The were first courses I took were: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>IS 6713 - Data Foundations</li>
                            <li>STA 6443 - Data Analytics Algorithms I</li>
                            <li>DA 6223 - Data Analytics Tools and Techniques</li>
                            <li>DA 6233 - Data Analytics Visualization and Communication</li>
							<li>MKT 6971 - Special Problems (Data Analytics Practicum I part 1)</li>
                        </ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Research</h3>
			<p>For the Spring 2022 semester I will be working with Dr. Anthony Rios to develop an interactive Question-Answering system that can detect 
                IoT threat and attack information. Using a grant from the DoD I will be monitoring undergraduate students as they produce SQL queries throughout all our datasets.</p>

			<h3>Post-Graduation & Career Goals</h3>
			<p>Starting in June 2022 I will be joining Goodman Manufacturing (a member of Daikin Industries) as a Logisitcs Solutions Engineer. Analyzing the supply chain, transportation,
                and distribution network I will be developing recommendations for reducing freight costs, creating material efficiencies, and improving on-time delivery. Maintaining 
                and communicating statistical data on the tracking of product and inventory while applying industry best practices and business analysis skills to help plan and define leading 
                solutions.
